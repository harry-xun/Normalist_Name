        <h2> What is this Data? </h2>
        <p> 
            This website runs off a dataset that contains names given to babies born in the United States of America.
            You can find the data on the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html" target="_blank">Social Security Website.</a> (Last accessed Feb 29 2024)
        </p>
        <p>
            This information in the dataset is sourced from The Social Security Administration(SSA) databases as of March 2023. 
            It covers names from 1880 - 2022, In the states and territories of the USA.
            No modifications were done to the available dataset, outside of formatting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dataset contains the amount of occurrences of the name, assigned to both males and females, per year. This allows us to examine trends of name popularity,
            usage for males and females, and get period specific names. Because we are using the full database here (as opposed to the SSA's top 1000) we have a wider
            and more diverse set of names, and more tools for analysis over time. We hope that this tool will be useful for getting name ideas and learning about usage history
            of names.
